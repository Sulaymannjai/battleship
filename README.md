## Introduction
Battleship Game is a Python implementation of the classic Battleship board game. It provides an interactive and engaging platform for players to challenge their logical reasoning and deduction skills. The game is played on a grid-based board, and the objective is to accurately guess and destroy the computer's hidden battleship within a limited number of turns.

## Features
-User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive design for players of all ages.
-Dynamic Board: Real-time updates of the game board after each move.
-Randomized Battleship Placement: Every game offers a new challenge.
-Turn-Based Gameplay: Test your skills within a limited number of turns.

## Game Logic
    Efficient Code Implementation
    The game logic is efficiently implemented, ensuring fast and responsive gameplay. Algorithms for validating user input and determining game outcomes are optimized for performance.

    Granular Functions and Logic Flow
    The game's logic is divided into well-defined granular functions. Each function serves a specific purpose, ensuring a consistent flow of logic. The separation of concerns enhances readability and maintainability.

    Fundamental Constructs and Object-Oriented Programming
    The code demonstrates a clear understanding of fundamental programming constructs such as loops, conditionals, functions, and data structures. Additionally, object-oriented programming principles are implemented where appropriate, enhancing code modularity and reusability.

## How to Play

### Board Setup:

The game board is a square grid with rows and columns.
The battleship is placed randomly on the board at the start of the game.

### Game Rules:

You have a limited number of turns to guess the battleship's location.
Enter your guess for the row and column when prompted.
If your guess matches the battleship's location, you win! Otherwise, the game will inform you if you missed.

### Game Status:

The game will display the updated board after each guess. Your guesses are marked with 'X'.
If you don't guess the battleship's location within the given number of turns, the game will reveal the battleship's position.

## Usage
Upon launching the game, follow the on-screen instructions to input your guesses for the battleship's location.
Analyze the board after each guess to strategize your next move.
Keep playing until you either sink the battleship or exhaust all your turns.

## Example Gameplay

### Turn 1
Guess Row: 2
Guess Col: 3
You missed my battleship!
Current Board:
O O O O O
O O O O O
O O X O O
O O O O O
O O O O O

...

### Turn 2
Guess Row: 2
Guess Col: 3
Congratulations! You sunk my battleship!
Current Board:
O O O O O
O O O O O
O X O O O
O O O O O
O O O O O

You sunk the battleship in 2 turns! Well done!

## Project Planning
Flow Charts and Diagrams
The project logic was meticulously planned and documented using flow charts and diagrams. These visual aids provided a roadmap for the code implementation, ensuring a structured and organized approach.

## Validation and Testing
    Error Handling and Fixes
    Validation errors were systematically addressed, with comprehensive fixes implemented. Each validation error was documented, and the fixes were applied methodically to enhance the application's robustness.

    Manual Testing and Code Validation
    Manual testing procedures, including PEP validators, were employed to validate the code. Test cases covered a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the application's correctness and reliability.
